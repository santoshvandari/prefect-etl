# CodeSnippet ETL Module

This folder contains example code snippets for building ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) flows using [Prefect](https://www.prefect.io/) and Python async features. The code is modular and demonstrates how to structure ETL tasks, flows, and backend API calls for orchestration and automation.

## Contents

- `backendcalling.py`: Async function to trigger Prefect flow runs via HTTP API, using environment variables for configuration.
- `etlcode.py`: Example Prefect tasks and flows for processing data asynchronously, including retry logic and task runners.
- `main.py`: Entrypoint for running a Prefect ETL deployment using environment parameters.
- `.env`: Example environment variables for Prefect API URL and deployment ID.

## Usage

1. **Set up environment variables**
   - Copy `.env` and update `ETL_DEPLOYMENT_ID` with your Prefect deployment ID.
   - Set `data1` and `data2` as needed for your ETL parameters.

2. **Install dependencies**
   - Ensure you have Python 3.8+ and install required packages (see main project `requirements.txt`).

3. **Run the ETL flow**
   - Execute `main.py` to start the ETL deployment:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

## Notes
- The code uses async/await for non-blocking operations.
- Prefect is used for orchestration, retries, and task management.
- Example MongoDB and HTTPX imports are included for extensibility.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- [Prefect](https://docs.prefect.io/)
- [aiohttp](https://docs.aiohttp.org/)

This folder is intended for demonstration and template purposes. Adapt the code to your specific ETL needs.
